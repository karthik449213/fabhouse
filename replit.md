## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No frameworks used, ensuring lightweight and fast loading
- **Static Website**: All pages are static HTML files with dynamic content rendered client-side
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: CSS media queries ensure optimal viewing across all devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with JS features

### Page Structure
The application consists of 5 main pages:
1. **Homepage (index.html)**: Hero section, featured products, brand information
2. **Shop Page (shop.html)**: Product grid with filtering and search capabilities
3. **Product Detail (product.html)**: Individual product showcase with image gallery
4. **Cart Page (cart.html)**: Shopping cart management and order summary
5. **Checkout Page (checkout.html)**: Order completion form and payment flow

## Key Components

### Navigation System
- **Consistent Header**: Fixed navigation across all pages with logo, menu, search, and cart
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear path indication for user orientation
- **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger menu for responsive mobile navigation

### Product Management
- **Product Database**: JavaScript object containing all product information including images, pricing, and specifications
- **Dynamic Product Rendering**: Products are rendered from JavaScript data for consistency
- **Image Gallery**: Multiple product images with thumbnail navigation
- **Product Filtering**: Category-based filtering system (UI implementation)

### Shopping Cart System
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Cart data maintained across browser sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant cart count and total updates
- **Quantity Management**: Add, remove, and modify product quantities
- **Price Calculations**: Dynamic total calculations with tax and shipping

### UI/UX Features
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and AOS (Animate On Scroll) library
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during interactions
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for checkout forms
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallbacks

## Data Flow

### Product Display Flow
1. JavaScript loads product database on page initialization
2. Products are filtered based on current page requirements
3. HTML is dynamically generated and inserted into the DOM
4. Images are lazy-loaded for performance optimization

### Shopping Cart Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" on product page
2. Product data is validated and added to cart array
3. Cart is synchronized with localStorage for persistence
4. UI updates reflect new cart count and totals
5. Cart page displays all items with modification options

### Checkout Flow
1. Cart data is validated before proceeding to checkout
2. User fills shipping and payment information
3. Form validation ensures required fields are completed
4. Order summary displays final totals and selected items
5. Mock order placement with success confirmation

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **AOS Library**: Animate On Scroll for entrance animations
- **Pixabay Images**: Stock photography for product demonstrations

### Browser APIs
- **localStorage**: Cart persistence across sessions
- **Fetch API**: Potential for future backend integration
- **Intersection Observer**: Image lazy loading optimization

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Simple Deployment**: All files are static and can be served from any web server
- **CDN Friendly**: Assets can be cached effectively for global distribution
- **No Server Requirements**: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar platforms

### Performance Optimization
- **Minified Assets**: CSS and JavaScript should be minified for production
- **Image Optimization**: Product images should be compressed and served in modern formats
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement browser caching for static assets

### SEO Considerations
- **Meta Tags**: Each page includes appropriate meta descriptions and titles
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements
- **Alt Text**: All images include descriptive alt attributes for accessibility

### Future Backend Integration
The architecture is designed to easily integrate with a backend system:
- **API Ready**: Cart and product management can be converted to API calls
- **Authentication Hooks**: User login/registration can be added without major restructuring
- **Database Migration**: Product data structure is ready for database implementation
- **Payment Integration**: Checkout form is structured for payment gateway integration
